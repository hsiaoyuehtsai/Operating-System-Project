## 1. **Inline Assembly and `rdtsc`**
   - Use inline assembly in C to add values to CPU registers and memory, and read the time-stamp counter (`rdtsc`) value into memory.

## 2. **Assembly String Input with `sys_read`**
   - Implement the `sys_read` system call in assembly to read a string of less than 100 characters.
